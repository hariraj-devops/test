package com.dremio.service.scheduler;

/**
 * Specifies the configuration of a group to which a given task and its schedule are associated
 * with. The group determines common resources such as thread pool used to execute a given task.
 * This allows different types of task to be executed under different thread pool(s), allowing for
 * better control of JVM resource usage by these tasks.
 *
 * <p>If a group is not specified for a task, the default group is used for the task. All groups
 * other than the 'default' group is modifiable, which means an external system outside the
 * scheduler can vary properties such as the capacity. The 'default' group must be provided while
 * constructing the scheduler service, along with a 'root path' that is common across service
 * instances of a given service, but must differ across different services.
