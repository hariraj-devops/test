        "text": "I like Chianti, the outdoor seating area is nice during the spring and fall, while the inside typifies an average Las Vegas dinner spot. The staff is attentive. Entrees are tasty, I liked the beef carpaccio appetizer, as well as the nice, simple pasta dishes and pizzas, and the cioppino is (surprisingly) pretty good too (although the tomato broth is a little overwhelming and the seafood is obviously not coastal fresh). The bread/crostini is horrible (ala white Wonder Bread). Decent wine list, but less than helpful staff in that regard. Overall, I would recommend this spot to anyone stranded in Vegas and craving a bowl of cioppino (p.s., if you know of a better spot for cioppino in Vegas please let me know).",
