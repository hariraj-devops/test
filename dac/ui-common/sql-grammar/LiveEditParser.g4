/*
 This extends DremioParser with rules overriden to allow (some) invalid queries to be successfully parsed.
 Autocomplete normally requires the query up to the cursor position to be valid so that candidate tokens can be
 properly identified by accurately determining the parser context at which the caret lies. Antlr4-c3 requires this as
 it does not use the actual parse result (which utilizes error recovery to resynchronize the input) but performs its
 own traversal based on the ATN directly. Therefore, using this custom parser's ATN and parse tree serves two purposes:
   1) To correctly collect candidates when the caret is beyond the FROM in a SELECT statement - even if the select
      clause is empty or has a trailing comma.
   2) To correctly parse the FROM clause to determine the tables in scope to suggest tables/column names when
      constructing the SELECT clause, even when empty or incomplete.

 This allows the following to produce suggestions:
   - SELECT FROM ^ (case 1)
   - FROM ^ (case 1)
   - SELECT ^ FROM tbl (case 2)
   - SELECT col1, ^ FROM tbl (case 2)
 */

/*
 Rule overrides
 If adding any new ones, make sure to add a test case in LiveEditParser.test.ts
 Do not add any rule overrides that make the grammar more restricted than the JavaCC/DremioParser grammar; otherwise,
 valid queries may show as having errors.
