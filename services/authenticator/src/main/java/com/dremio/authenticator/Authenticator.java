/**
 * This interface defines an API for authentication. Implementations of this interface are
 * responsible for performing authentication, retrieving information about the authenticated user
 * and auditing.
 *
 * <p>Authentication involves validating user credentials (e.g., username/password) or verifying the
 * authenticity of a token.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Authenticator authenticator = new BasicAuthenticator();
 *     AuthRequest authRequest = AuthRequest.builder()
 *       .setUsername("USERNAME HERE")
 *       .setToken("PASSWORD HERE")
 *       .setResource(AuthRequest.Resource.USER_RPC)
 *       .build();
 *     try {
 *       AuthResult authResult = authenticator.authenticate(authRequest);
 *       authResult.getUserName();
 *       // Perform authorized actions for the authenticated user.
 *     } catch (AuthException e) {
 *       // Handle authentication failure.
 *     }
 * </pre>
