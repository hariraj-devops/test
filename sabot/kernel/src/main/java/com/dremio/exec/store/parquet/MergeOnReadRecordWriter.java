/**
 * Record Writer for Merge On Read DML operations.
 *
 * <p>This writer serves as a container for two unique ParquetRecordWriters:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>dataFileRecordWriter:</b> Responsible for writing data files.
 *   <li><b>deleteFileRecordWriter:</b> Responsible for writing positional delete files.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is essential to note that each positional delete file must be written with entries sorted
 * by 'file_path', 'pos' in ascending (ASC) order. For partitioned-tables, this is handled during
 * planning - We added the system columns to the Sort Operator during partition-based sort. For
 * un-partitioned-tables or partitioned-and-sortOrder-defined-tables, delete files are written in a
 * two-step process:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>First, the delete records are stored in memory using a {@link VectorSorter}. The sorter
 *       will continue to consume incoming batches until notified to stop. Once notified to stop,
 *       the sorter will sort the consumed in-memory, then notify the operator that it has a pending
 *       output awaiting to write, then finally be passed to a {@link WritableVectorSorter} queue.
 *       <p><b>The sorter is notified its done consuming (i.e. CAN_PRODUCE) under any of the
 *       following conditions </b>:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>The sorter's memory is full
 *         <li>The sorter's memory has hit its row-count maximum
 *         <li>There is no more data to consume from the Operator
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>Second, the sorted delete records are written to the delete file. This occurs whenever the
 *       operator has moved to the CAN_PRODUCE state.
 * </ol>
