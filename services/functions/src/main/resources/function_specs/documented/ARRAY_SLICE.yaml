    parameters:
      - kind: REGULAR
        type: ARRAY
        name: arr
        description: The source array of which a subset of the elements are used to construct the resulting array.
      - kind: REGULAR
        type: INT
        name: from
        description: A position in the source array. The position of the first element is 0. Elements from positions less than from are not included in the resulting array.
      - kind: REGULAR
        type: INT
        name: to
        description: A position in the source array. Elements from positions equal to or greater than to are not included in the resulting array.

description: "Returns an array constructed from a specified subset of elements of the input array./n
              The output includes elements up to, but not including the element specfied by the parameter to./n
              If the array is NULL, the result is NULL./n
              If either from or to is NULL, the result is NULL./n
              If either from or to is negative, it is relative to the end of the array, not the beginning of the array. E.g. “-2” refers to the second-from-the-last position in the array./n
              If from and to are both beyond the upper end of the array, or are both beyond the lower end of the array, then the result is the empty set./n"
